##### TASK 2 Assignment2-GNU-Make-and-GCC
> The make file is in src directory. #USE $make build PLATFORM=MSP432 or $make build PLATFORM=HOST to build  

> Assignment is my solution to Coursera's Embedded Software Essentials course specialization, module 2.  
  Familiarizes with GNU's gcc, Make, size, objcpy and objdump utilities.

> In this programming assignment I created a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make.

#### Gatherings
Use GCC and GNU Make to create a command line build system and write a makefile that can natively and cross compile an application.  


#### In this programming assignment I created a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make. This assignment required me to compile multiple files, link them together and create a final output executable. Some files will be provided for you, but you will need to support two platforms; the host environment and the target embedded system MSP432. The host system allowed me to simulate software on a host platform. The target system be used in upcoming assignments as we begin to create our microcontroller applications.
